# Profit-Analysis-using-Regression-

### Project overview:

This project is centered around understanding the key drivers of profitability within a business using dataset which holds data from startups in Newyork,California and Florida. The objective is to identify which factors — such as Marketing Spend, R&D Spend, and Administration Costs — have the most significant impact on profit.

To achieve this, I performed a multiple linear regression analysis in Excel to quantify the relationships between variables and then presented the findings through interactive dashboards in Power BI. The dashboards highlight high- and low-performing areas across departments and help translate the data into actionable business insights.

This project not only demonstrates my ability to derive insights from data but also showcases my proficiency in business storytelling, data visualization, and financial analysis.
